## Mini FAQ

* Why are you doing this?

We want to achieve great things and we would like to put our
competence to good use where it is appreciated.

* What are the features of CoinX?

We can't go into detail at this point. You can assume PoC (Proof of
Capacity) is somehow involved. The code base is new/from
scratch. There are several unique features planned. Equally important
as the technicals is the CoinX community, which will also be
architected "from scratch".

* When will CoinX be available?

No ETA whatsoever.

* Will there be a white paper?

White paper and code will be published at the same time. There may be
preliminary publications of partial features or aspects of the coin
before that.

* Can't you really share more information?

This repository will - probably over time - give more and more hints
of what is likely and what is unlikely to have in CoinX.
